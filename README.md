4. Hook up each of the two laptops to an HDMI -> RCA audio video converter

5. For each of the two audio outputs and for the one video output for the
    adapter add a signal splitter that converts the single RCA output into two identical outputs

6. Hook up each of the two outputs to two different TVS's (repeat for each laptop)

7. Take another copy of the stereo audio mix from each of the two laptops and mix them together using
    an audio mixer. (each of the systems should live 75% on opposite side of the mix)

8. Duplicate the Mix and route it to two headphones that are place on the table in front of the TV's

9. Plug a Nano Kontrol into each of the two laptops and place in front of the TV's (if black and white Nano are present alternate the knob and slider colors)
